# Wave Forge Benchmark Results

This document provides benchmark results for the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) implementation in Wave Forge, comparing CPU and GPU performance across different grid sizes and configurations.

## Benchmark Methodology

The benchmarks measure the performance of the Wave Function Collapse algorithm under different conditions:

- **Implementations**: Both CPU (single-threaded and parallel) and GPU implementations are benchmarked
- **Grid Sizes**: Multiple 3D grid sizes ranging from small (8³) to large (32³)
- **Metrics**:
  - Total execution time
  - Memory usage
  - Iterations required for convergence
  - Performance hotspots (profiled sections)

Each benchmark is run multiple times and the results are averaged to ensure consistency.

## How to Run Benchmarks

You can run the benchmarks yourself using the following command:

```bash
wave-forge --rule-file <path_to_rule_file> --benchmark-mode --benchmark-csv-output benchmark_results.csv
```

Optional parameters:

- `--global-log-level debug` - For more detailed output
- `--cpu-only` - To run only CPU benchmarks (useful on systems without GPU support)

## Analysis

### Observations

1. **Scaling Efficiency**: The GPU advantage increases with grid size, showing the most benefit for larger problems.
2. **Memory Tradeoff**: GPU implementations use more memory but provide significant speed improvements.
3. **Bottlenecks**:
   - CPU: Entropy calculation is the primary bottleneck
   - GPU: Constraint propagation dominates, despite being accelerated

### Platform-Specific Considerations

#### CPU Implementation

- Benefits from multi-threading via `rayon` for grids larger than 16×16×16
- Can run on any hardware that supports Rust
- Better for memory-constrained environments
- Better for smaller problem sizes (< 8×8×8) due to lower overhead

#### GPU Implementation

- Requires compatible GPU hardware and drivers
- Significant speedup for large grids
- Includes memory overhead for buffer allocations and shader compilation
- Data transfer between CPU and GPU can become a bottleneck

## Recommendations

Based on the benchmark results, we recommend:

- Use the GPU implementation for grids larger than 16×16×16 when suitable hardware is available
- Use the parallel CPU implementation for medium-sized grids (8×8×8 to 16×16×16)
- Use the single-threaded CPU implementation for small grids (< 8×8×8)

## Future Optimizations

Potential areas for performance improvement:

1. **CPU Implementation**:
   - Improved cache locality in entropy calculation
   - More efficient data structures for propagation
2. **GPU Implementation**:
   - Reduce CPU-GPU data transfer with persistent buffers
   - Optimize workgroup sizes based on grid dimensions
   - Implement workgroup memory for better locality
